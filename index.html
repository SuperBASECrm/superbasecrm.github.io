      <h1>Spend more time selling, less time juggling tools.</h1>
      <p>A CRM should feel like a co-pilot. SuperBase keeps your companies, contacts, tasks, and sequences aligned so every touchpoint is timely, relevant, and effortless, freeing your focus for real selling.</p>

        <h3>Why a CRM matters</h3>
        <p>Every deal starts with clarity: who you talked to, what you promised, and when to follow up. A good CRM removes guesswork, keeps history tight, and surfaces the next best action automatically.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="home-card">
        <h3>Built for sales reps</h3>
        <p>Quick capture, zero fluff. Create companies, contacts, tasks, and opportunities in seconds, and jump back into the pipeline view without losing momentum.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="home-card">
        <h3>Energy conservation</h3>
        <p>Busy work like logging calls and sending follow-ups is important, but it drains energy when it is scattered. Centralize it, automate what repeats, and keep your effort for the conversations that close.</p>

      <div class="home-pill">Sequences in real life</div>
      <h2 class="home-subtitle">Sales is rarely a one-touch game</h2>
      <p class="home-text">Most deals take multiple touchpoints over weeks, months, or even years before a conversation truly starts. With multiple accounts and timelines, it is easy to lose track. Sequences help you stay present without burning out.</p>
      <div class="home-mini-grid">
        <div class="home-card">
          <h3>Structured follow-through</h3>
          <p>Plan the arc of your outreach: first touch, value reminder, proof, ask. Each step is scheduled so nothing slips.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="home-card">
          <h3>Across accounts, calmly</h3>
          <p>Manage dozens of accounts without feeling scattered. The CRM queues the next step and due date for every contact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="home-card">
          <h3>Stay relevant</h3>
          <p>Blend templates with personal notes so touches feel thoughtful, not robotic, even when they are planned weeks apart.</p>
